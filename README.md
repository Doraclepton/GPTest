# GPTest - About the program
The program has 3 operating modes: input; processing; full processing. \
Modes: 

Input mode - the mode in which the user enters their code. 

Processing mode - the mode of scanning user code for the presence of libraries.

Full processing mode - the mode of processing user code and displaying information to the user about possible actions of the code; 


To create comments, simply use the hash symbol (#) \
The program does not handle libraries well in full processing.

# GPTest - version 0.0.2
1)Fixes for syntax errors in incomplete parsing \
2)Adding official Doraclepton/Dora images to the code 

In future updates I will try to add the function of handling the 2nd programming language!
